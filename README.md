# Weight Mate: a workout tracking app

This is an app built using Django and React to track gym workouts. It's simple in scope but is fairly complete in functionality, including PWA compliancy.

## Technologies used:
- ReactJS
- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- MySQL


## Hosting
The app is configured for hosting the backend on Heroku, and the frontend on any static site hosting service. I had been using AWS S3 for hosting a static site out of an S3 bucket.
